%  This section is optional, and is designed for a write up of any hacking or
%  modifications you may have made due to being hacked. You may also describe modifications 
%  that went above the minimum requirements, and why they were necessary. (Note:
%  It is important to follow the lab description through entirely and get it checked with a
%  teaching assistant before you attempt any experiments. Hacking should also be left until
%  after April 20, 2018.)
